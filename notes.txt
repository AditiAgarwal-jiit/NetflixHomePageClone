1. To allow our app to send request, we gone use AXIOS.
2. Setup AXIOS (request sender).
3. Create request endpoints (request objects) in requests.js.
4. Create axios.js for sending requests.

5. Add rows components in App.js and re-use the same component by passing different props.
6. Create Row.js for building the component.

--> It's imp to give id to all pictures in each row, because when we have to render
   so many rows containing so many items, it's important to make rendering efficient and optimized and slightly
   faster.
   Also, if anything changes in that row, React doesn't simply re-render that entire row.
   It just re-renders what it needs to re-render.
